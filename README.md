HangMan
This is a game where a player has to choose a catrgory, either animals of foods. The computer will randomly select a word from that the catrgory that the player must guess. 
The player will have 6 atempts to guess the word before the hangman is drewn. Once the hang man is drewen the player will loose the game. If the player guess the word before the hangman is 
drewn they will win. I chose this game becouse this we my first  full website I built, and i thought it would be easy to do.
